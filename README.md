# Pneumonia-Detection
Using Chest-X Ray images from a very well known Kaggle Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia), we can use Deep Learning models to detect Pneumonia.
## Motivation
Healthcare is an important part of the current technological revolution, with more and more fields like Deep Learning applying methods to this versatile and pivotal field. Pneumonia is a very common infection with more than 10 million cases annually. Detecting this infection at an early stage using a simple chest x-ray scan could prove to be a game-changer
